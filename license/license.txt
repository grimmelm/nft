The IC3 NFT License (the "License") grants you certain intellectual property rights with respect to Licensed Material associated with an NFT. When you acquire the NFT, you own the personal property rights to the token underlying the NFT (e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that  NFT), but you do not own the associated Licensed Material. Instead, the Licensor grants you a specified limited license to use the Licensed Material, as set forth below:


Definitions

	Ledgers and NFTs:

		A "Unique Identifier" is information that is sufficient to distinguish one digital record from other digital records.
		
		A "Ledger" is a blockchain, database, or other digital system that records information about Unique Identifiers.
		
		A "Private Key" is a cryptographic key, the use of which is necessary to modify the information about a Unique Identifier recorded in a Ledger.
		
		A "Unique Identifier" in a Ledger is "Associated" with a person or entity when that person or entity has substantially exclusive control over the Private Key necessary to modify the information about that Unique Identifier in that Ledger.
		
		An "NFT" is a Unique Identifier in a Ledger that is Associated with a person or entity.
		
		The "Controller" of an NFT is the person or entity with whom the NFT is Associated.

	Licensing

		"License" means the intellectual property license granted under the terms of this document.

		A "Licensing Process" is a technical process (including a smart contract that implements Ethereum Improvement Protocol XXX or any update, revision, new version, or successor thereof) designed to allow authorized parties to specify the current status of intellectual property license terms associated with an NFT and any related material, including the text of a license. A Licensing Process can (but need not) specify whether the license has been sublicensed, transferred, and/or revoked.

		An NFT "Invokes" this License when the NFT refers to the verbatim text of this License by means of a Licensing Process.
		
		The "Licensor" means the individual or entity that causes an NFT to Invoke this License.
		
		The "License NFT" is the NFT that Invokes this License. If more than one NFT Invokes this License, each such NFT is a separate License NFT resulting in a separate and distinct license grant with respect to the Licensed Material respectively associated with each such NFT.


	Licensed and Adapted Material

		An NFT is "Linked" to material when the NFT contains, in a form which is substantially immutable in the ordinary course of operation of the digital system, a description of, or hyperlink to that material.

		"Licensed Material" means the creative work or other material to which the License NFT is Linked.

		"Adapted Material" means material subject to copyright and similar rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the copyright and similar rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. For purposes of this License, the exact reproduction of the Licensed Material in a different medium in a manner not requiring original creative effort (such as printing a photographic or pictorial work on paper) does not produce Adapted Material.

		"Commercial" means primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this License, activity is Commercial if direct or indirect payment is required as a condition of access to the Licensed Material or Adapted Material. For purposes of this License, the sale and advertising for sale of the License NFT (including the rights granted under this License) is not Commercial.

		"Non-Commercial" means not Commercial.

		To "Use" material is to copy, display, distribute, make available to the public, or perform it.


	Ownership and Transfers

		The "Owner" of an NFT is the person or entity who is entitled to be its Controller  property laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
		
		"You" are the person receiving rights under this License as the Owner of the License NFT.

		An NFT "Revokes" this License when the NFT indicates that it has been revoked by means of a Licensing Process.

		An NFT is "Sublicened" when the NFT indicates that it has been sublicensed by means of a Licensing Process.

		To "Transfer" an NFT is to change, modify, or update the Ledger such that the identity of the Owner of that NFT changes, by any legally sufficient means, including sale, barter, gift, bequest, or operation of law. 




License Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, and for as for as long as You are the Owner of the License NFT, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, non-exclusive, license:
* to Use the Licensed Material [If NC: for Non-Commercial purposes only],
* [If D] to create and Use Adapted Material [If NC: for Non-Commercial purposes only],
* to Use the Licensed Material in connection with the sale and advertising for sale of the License NFT,
* to identify You as the Owner of the License NFT.

This License becomes effective when the Licensor causes the License NFT to Invoke it. Because this is a unilateral license grant and not a contract, your assent is not required for it to become effective.

This license grant is non-transferable, except that if the License NFT is Transferred, your rights under this license grant will terminate, and such rights will automatically transfer to the new Owner of the License NFT. Any sublicenses granted hereunder that are Sublicensed will continue in force as sublicenses from the new Owner.

If the License NFT Revokes this License, your rights under this license grant will terminate, along with all sublicenses granted hereunder.


Interpretation

By adopting this License, the Licensor intends to enhance the clarity and predictability of intellectual-property licensing via digital transactions. In cases of doubt or ambiguity, the terms of this license should be interpreted and applied to promote the goals of (1) making the information in the Digital System accurately reflect the licensing relationships it describes, and vice versa, (2) providing clear, simple, and unambiguous mechanisms for parties to express their licensing intentions, (3) protecting parties from duress, fraud, forgery, and mistake, and (4) achieving uniformity and consistency in the application of this License to different transactions, at different times, and in different jurisdictions.
